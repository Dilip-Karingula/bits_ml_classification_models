# bits_ml_classification_models
This Project is to implement various ML classification models

# 1. Problem statement 
      1. Choose any dataset from public repository with minimum 12 features and 500 data instances / samples
      2. Implement the following classification models using the dataset chosen above.
          1. Logistic Regression 
          2. Decision Tree Classifier 
          3. K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier 
          4. Naive Bayes Classifier - Gaussian or Multinomial 
          5. Ensemble Model - Random Forest 
          6. Ensemble Model - XGBoost 
      3. Calculate the following evaluation metrics for each models list above: 
          1. Accuracy 
          2. AUC Score 
          3. Precision 
          4. Recall 
          5. F1 Score 
          6. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC Score) 
      4. Implementation should be performed on BITS Virtual Lab
      5. Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud with features
          1. Dataset upload option 
          2. Model selection dropdown
          3. Display of evaluation metrics 
          4. Confusion matrix or classification report
